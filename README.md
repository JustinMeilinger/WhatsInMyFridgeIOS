3.Grocery List Automater
	Description:
		There is a bar code scanner on your refrigerator that scans items in when they are bought and scans them out when they are thrown out, through this we track what items are finished and need to be replaced this data syncs with a smart phone and an app that creates a list for you of every time that needs to be replaced 
		This can be taking further by taking the scanned items looking them up on a data base to find nutritional value and track a persons diet and how they get eat better.
